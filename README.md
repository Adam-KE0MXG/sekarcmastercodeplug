# sekarcmastercodeplug

This is a repository for a codeplug for the SEKARC club. It is a work in
progress that needs attention from the club and other ham radio operators 
that this applies to.

Please for edits run them through a pull request and the admins of this
codeplug will check and approve changes. All programming should be done in
the TYT CPS for the MD380 and the DMR Contact manager application.

******NOTE: This codeplug is not for the MD2017 or the Radioddity GD-77  or any
other radio except for the MD380 UHF DMR HT.********

In ~/csv/

There are master csv lists of all of the contacts and channels 
(in their repspective subfolders) that are in the codeplug as is. 
The md-380 supports around 1000 channels and 1000 contacts.

In ~/md380-master/

There is a current copy of the codeplug without a DMR radio number or 
Callsign.

In ~/md380-supp-codeplugs/

There is a collection of codeplugs that are from other sources that are for
the repeaters in Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Arkansas that are presently
within the current codeplug.

A list of known issues will be kept in the issue tracker at:
https://github.com/Adam-KE0MXG/sekarcmastercodeplug/issues

Please submit bug reports there.
